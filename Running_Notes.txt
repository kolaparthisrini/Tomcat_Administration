Apache Tomcat
-------------
Installation
Configuration(Nodes)
Deployments 
Configuration files
Data source configurations
Clustering Configuration
------
Tomcat 8.5
apache http server---apache24
mysql connector
mod utility
Eclipse/Sts
Notepad++
tomcat on docker(optional).
---------------------------
HTTP protocol:
1.0/1.1/2.x

FTP==for transfering file

.....etc

web app will reside in web/app server.
*Http is stateless protocol.

to access an app which exsists inserver,we aare using Browsers(User agent)
Http==which is insecure
Https=which is secure
https=Http+SSl

Http===>Headers(request and response cycle)
Https=>will need to bind security/digital certificates to sever.

Certificates:2 types of cert.
1)Commercial certificate(in prod)
vendor issued certificates Ex:verisgn,godaddy,paypal..

2)Self signed certificate(are created on our own)

self signed cert are used for local testing.
In prod,we shld not use self.
tool:keytool

cipher/private/public/digital cert/algo/vault...etc

Apache Tomcat Web server:

Http Engine+Catalina+Jasper+Middleware Services(tx management,lifecycle management,datasources,jndi sources...)

nearly 16+ middleware services.

Catalina is servlet container.

Jasper is jsp container
Http Engine is a component which will process ur http requests.

Example for Web servers:tomcat,resign,nginx,jetty....etc

App server:

Http engine+Catalina+Jasper+Middleware services+EJb container+Messaging/MQ Container

Web--2
App--4

Example:  Weblogic/websphere/glassfish/IBM.....etc


Apache tomcat server:
Apache is http server
tomcat is container component(catalina and jasper)


Monitoring Tools:

Jstat/JvisualVM/Jconsole/Appdynamics.....etc

Jvisulavm:Any app or S/w which uses JDK can be monitored
using Jvisual VM.

JMX Beans

If u want to take dumps or profile any thing,then java uses
instrumentation feature.

Load testing:Jmeter.....
----------------------------------------

To inspect/view the http traffic ,simply inspect the 
networking section of web page on browser.

Tomcat 8.5:

Protocols: Http/https and AJP protoc0l.

Http:2.x
AJP:1.3
AJP? 
1)Ajp is used for communication b/w Apache httpd server
and tomcat containers.
2)To communicate with containers and to perform loaad balancing,AJP is must.

conf:this is the place for entire tomcat metadata configuration.

lib is place for libraries(3rd party lib)

logs:By default tomcat uses "juli"
and java.util.Logging to enable logging on the servers.

Webapps--is a place where u r going to deploy or place ur war files.

bin--is a location from where we can
control or config the server and security parts of the server.


Default Http Port no is 8080/80

HTTPS port no is 8443/443

--------------------

Conf:

catalina.policy==used for creating and modifying security polices  on tomcat
Realm

grant


Context.xml:USed for connection pooling config and jndi config shlb config under <context>.


Logging.properties:log config

Default log encoding tech:UTF8


Unicode:UTF16


Main comp of tomcat server.xml:

-->Load balancing
Node config
Routing
Http connector config
Https connector config
cluster config
Virtualhost config..etc

How to resolve port conflicts for tomcat?

Edit Connector tag under server.x
ml.

---------
Shutdownport=8006
Http portno =8888
Https Portno=8443
AJP version=1.3
AJP Port no=8009
Hostname=localhost


-------------------

tomcat-users is a location where
we are going to config cerdentials for a user and permissions.
