How Load balancer knows when one tomcat instance is failed or tomcat is just recovered from failed state?
Sol)
Ans : when one tomcat instance is failed, load balancer don't know about that instances is failed. so its try to forward the request
to all tomcat instances. If load balancer try to forward the request to failed tomcat instance, its will not respond. 
so load balancer understand and marked the state as a failed and forward the same request to another tomcat instances. 
so client perspective we not feel one tomcat instances are failed. 

when tomcat instances recovered from failed state. that time also load balancer don't know that tomcat is ready for processing. 
Its still marked the state is failed. In periodic interval load balancer checks the health status of all tomcat instances.
(by default 60 sec). after checking health status then only load balancer came to know that tomcat instance is ready. and its
update the status is OK
